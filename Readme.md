## Features

* Automatic parsing of `background`, `background-image` and `content` for `url({{absoluteUrl}})` in stylesheets and scripts.
* Built-in optimization of images in production mode using binaries from NPM of [OptiPNG][1] and [JPEGTran][2].
* Supports [Sass][3], [LESS][4], and [Stylus][5] using respective stylesheet compilers.
* JavaScript assets are mangled and minified using [UglifyJS][6].
* Automatic detection of asset changes and will only upload changed assets to S3 in production mode.
* Utilizes cachebusting, which is inspired by [express-cachebuster][7] and [h5bp][8].
* All assets are compressed using [zlib][9] into a gzip buffer for S3 uploading with `Content-Encoding` header set to `gzip`.
* Embed multiple assets as a single `<script>` or `<link>` tag using the built-in dynamic view helper.
* Loads and processes assets per view (allowing you to minimize client HTTP requests).
* Combine commonly used assets together using a simple array argument.
* Uploads changed assets automatically and asynchronously to Amazon S3 (only in production mode) using [knox][10].


## How does it work?

* Grunt task that loads the assets to S3
* Library interacts with assets in templates to serve either single production asset or normal files for development


## Environment Differences

**Development Mode:**

Assets are untouched, cachebusted, and delivered as typical local files for rapid development.

**Production Mode:**

Assets are optimized, minified, mangled, gzipped, delivered by Amazon CloudFront CDN, and hosted from Amazon S3.
